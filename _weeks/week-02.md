# Thank You!

I just wanted to officially thank you again for leading out with ROOTED in your group. I pray you’re already being blessed as you personally journey together.

As a reminder each week, I’ll send a quick training email, video and other insights to help us stay on the same page. Please take a few short minutes (3 to be exact…) to watch the [Week 2 Training Video](https://vimeo.com/album/3815216/video/156492485) and be sure to review the training notes about facilitating discussion.

## Remember...

1) A great Rooted Facilitator is an excellent listener.
2) Rooted may be the only place where your group member feels truly heard. Foster that kind of dialogue and honor the covenant.

- Validate your group member’s perspectives, while leading people toward truth.
- Point them to the Bible, but understand we all have baggage, especially related to this question.
- Allow people to be honest, even if you’re uncomfortable with their perspective. Your conversation will help lead you toward a better view for everyone.
- Don’t teach. Listen and seek to understand.
- Ask follow up, clarifying, and open-ended questions.

## Notes for This Week

We will become like the God we worship. Don’t miss the opportunity here. This might seem really basic, but it’s consistently worth revisiting who we’re actually talking about when it comes to the God we claim to worship. This might sneakily be the most important week for someone in your group.

- Reflect on your own misconceptions about God.
- The parental figures in someone’s life will affect a person’s view of God.
- Be sensitive to the potential scars that you don’t know about yet.
- Jesus is the perfect representation of God’s character (Hebrews 1:3). 

### Story Sharing
Group members will begin sharing their faith stories. Around 2-3 people should share their story each week (over the next 10 weeks) until all have shared. For Week 2, a leader should be the first to model this.

NOTE: 

While group members share their stories, leaders should take notes. This will be helpful for prayers throughout and especially on layout: week0.

### Prayer Partners

At the end of the week, encourage your group to break into pairs and partner to hold one another accountable throughout the week.

### Planning Center Groups AND Attendance

You should have received an email notifying you that your group is now online. Planning Center Groups is our online application that will help you manage your members, plan events, take attendance, and share resources.

If you have been made a leader of a group, [THIS ARTICLE](https://pcogroups.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006319853-Introduction-to-Groups-for-Leaders) will go over the main functions of the app and help you get started with your group!

We are asking that you please update your roster, add any/all meeting times to the calendar and begin to take attendance at your sessions so we can gauge involvement and engagement…and give you the best tools to succeed! If you need help taking attendance on Planning Center, watch this short [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/jNBhFoiogXQ). 

If you need assistance with this, please contact myself or Emily Dreger @ edreger@firstchristian.com
