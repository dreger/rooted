# WELCOME!

I have been praying for YOU and that by leading a Rooted group, committing to the full 10 weeks of intentional time with its practices, and connecting with others, you will begin to experience that power for yourself. I’m humbled by all that God is doing through Rooted and consider it a great privilege to share this experience with you!

As we prepare to Launch, here are the final items we’ll need to help you succeed:

## Day/Time You Plan to Meet

If you have a planned day, time and/or location set, please notify me and I’ll update our records. If you’re choosing on Sunday with your group members, simply respond “TBD @ Launch.”

## Rooted or Lifegroup

If you have made the decision to launch ROOTED as a LifeGroup, or simply to serve as a ROOTED Facilitator/Pilot, please respond accordingly.

## Pray

As we stated, many of our ROOTED Groups are stepping out in faith and seeking connecting for the first time…which is scary.

Begin to pray for your members by name and for all God plans to accomplish over the next 10 weeks!

>>HOW CAN I PRAY FOR YOU?

Seriously…I’m carving out time/space to pray for each of you (and your groups) individually and would love to know any specific needs or concerns you may have.

(NOTE: All requests are confidential and will remain so, but want you to know you’re valued and supported.)

As always, if you have any questions, concerns or simply want to know more about getting connected @ FCC, email nextsteps@firstchristian.com anytime.
