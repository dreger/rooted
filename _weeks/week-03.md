- Please take a few short minutes to watch the Week 3 Training Video and [Prayer Experience – Facilitator Training Video](https://vimeo.com/album/3815216/video/156493836). 

## Prayer Experience Communication Checklist

- Date – Consider how this affects the flow of their daily devotions and your weekly discussion.
- Time – Clarify how the three hours is broken up: 30 minutes together. 45 minutes to 1 hour on your own. An hour debriefing & breaking your fast together.
- Location (see below ) – Make sure there’s room to spread out. Prioritize any outdoor space if the weather holds up. Consider finding a way to set the tone with music or lighting.
Fasting specifics (see below)
- Childcare – You already handle this regularly, but it’ll be different for this experience.
What to bring: Bibles, notebooks, Rooted books, pen, other devotional materials, location-specific clothing.
- Technology – Maybe collect phones during the prayer. Try to help people put themselves in a situation where they can disconnect. If your space might be crowded, suggest bringing headphones and instrumental music, but encourage them to turn their phones on airplane mode or something.
- Remind people to prepare – rest, excitement, having read through their Rooted Prayer Experience Page.

## Leader Preparation Notes

The Prayer Experience is typically the most dramatic turning point in your group. Do your best to prioritize this experience and do whatever you can to get everyone there. Plan out the way you’re going to begin the experience: logistics on the front end (where can they go to be alone?), choosing passages to read, and praying together as a group.

I’d highly encourage you to consider fasting as a group. Agree on the duration and what’s still on the table. I typically choose to go from dinner to dinner and allow all liquids. However, for obvious reasons, probably stay away from any alcohol. Fasting is all about controlling our desires. When we choose to willfully overpower a desire for something we need (like food), we’re more capable of controlling our willpower over something we only want. Especially in those moments of fasting too that we can realize just how much our hunger is spiritual.

When we satisfy our spiritual needs in focussed connection with God through prayer, we can better tell the difference between our physical hunger and spiritual hunger. And we’ll find that the second one is surprisingly stronger. There are more notes in the Facilitator’s Guide appendix and [HERE](https://firstchristian.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FASTING.pdf)
 
## Possible Locations

The location of your group will be crucial to think through. If, by God’s grace, the weather is warm enough, consider doing this outdoors, but be sensitive to your groups feelings about this. But please consider all your options first, as this may cost the church some extra money. 
 
Open up this need to your group and see if they have any suggestions. A house is just fine or a clubhouse or a chapel or church. 
 
However, if you need a location more conducive to an extended, spacious time, please reach out to me, Shawn Maurer @ nextsteps@firstchristian.com 

## Guided Prayer

The book offers some great suggestions. Encourage your group to come with a plan. However, HERE is a more detailed guided prayer experience for anyone that thinks they might really struggle with this. Print a few of these off, front and back, and offer them to your group. A few people will appreciate it. I’ll also have this available onsite should you be a part of the Prayer Experience on campus.

### A few tips to prepare for the ROOTED Prayer Experience

- Review your journal for areas in your own life that you will want to incorporate into your prayer time. 
- Come to the meeting without your To-Do Lists, Mobile Device(s) or Day Planners.
- Communicate with your group to consider a plan to fast (see below) until the end of the Experience.
- Silence is ok and will allow for God to do the work.


### The plan for the group’s Prayer Experience is SIMPLE

- Sit with your Group and create a place/time to pray collectively 
- You will participate in a guided, 30 minute Group Prayer time 
- You will then be dismissed for an extended, 30 minute Individual Prayer Time to the space of your choosing (on campus). 
- NOTE: Bring YOUR ROOTED Book with you to read along & use for individual prayer/journaling.
 
### Ideas for Fasting

In order to make the most of your experience with your Rooted group, we recommend you spend time preparing to hear from God. One of the disciplines that helps with this is fasting. Fasting is a way we can eliminate the noise and distractions of our daily routines and focus more completely on hearing God’s voice. While we fast, we are reminded and become more aware of our dependence on God. By fasting, we also intensify our prayers by placing ourselves in a position of submission and often become more sensitive to hearing God’s voice. 
 
Fasting can take various forms, but here are 3 commonly suggested areas to consider: 

- Food/Drink: Refrain from eating prior to meeting. This could be as simple as skipping breakfast or your morning coffee, to eliminating key foods (sugar, carbs, etc). 
- Digital: Remove your wearable tech, leave your phone turned off, ignore social media or silence all devices.
- Routine: Skip your regular workout, reading time, appointment or habit and instead use that time to prepare, pray or practice a different Spiritual Discipline. 

Talk to your group and communicate what you are fasting FROM and WHEN you plan to begin AND break your fast (ex: tonight after dinner, tomorrow morning only, after prayer experience, our next group time, etc.).
 
I pray that this message encourages and excites you as much for tomorrow to come as it does me, but if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call, text, email or drop by to connect.
