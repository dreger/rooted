Here you’ll find some quick training tips for your upcoming group experience, as well as this week’s FULL Teaching Video ([Make It Count – Treasure](https://vimeo.com/fcccanton/review/325324428/b80236eb6d)) and other insights to help us stay on the same page. 

Please take a few short minutes to watch the Week 8 Training Video and be sure to review pages 81-85 in your Facilitator Guide for tips on how to lead a Serve Experience. 

## Notes for This Week

### We Will Not Be Regrouping on Campus for Week 8!

Despite the print version of the Facilitator Guide (and training video), do not make plans to come to campus. Instead, we encourage you to watch/share the Message Video from the Make It Count series in your regular time/venues so as to allow more time for discussion/processing together. Our leaders did a great job unpacking the importance of biblical finances and, as such, we don’t see long term impact by bringing the groups back on site and out of rhythm when unnecessary. 

*(Note: If you feel uncomfortable fielding questions or have additional questions or concerns, please contact nextsteps@firstchristian.com and we can help you prepare.)*

### Serving Forms

We don’t have print versions outside of First Step due to the higher volume of options online, as well as response rate/retention when people sign up online. You can access that HERE. 

## Generosity

**“Why are we going to talk about Generosity?”** You might be asking this question. I certainly was. We want to make sure we get this conversation right and have everyone on the same page. 

Christians are only giving at 2.5% of their income right now. If they would only double this we’d be able to substantially address most, if not all, preventable suffering. That’s particularly helpful as we remember the week 4 conversations. “Where is God in suffering?” Maybe part of the question is “Where are we in suffering?” [For more data on this idea, check out this article](https://relevantmagazine.com/love-and-money/what-would-happen-if-church-tithed).

More importantly, money is a sacred idol for most people. That’s true for modern Americans in a society that’s built on capitalism and consumerism. Not that any of that is evil at all, it just grants money a lot of power in our lives. Jesus’ appearance on the planet was perfectly timed, as economies were increasingly moving toward a money-based economy (rather than goods-based) and were more interconnected than ever, His teaching about money was extensive. Look at this quote from leadership and financial teacher Howard Dayton:

*Jesus talked much about money. Sixteen of the thirty-eight parables were concerned with how to handle money and possessions. In the Gospels, an amazing one out of ten verses (288 in all) deal directly with the subject of money. The Bible offers 500 verses on prayer, less than 500 verses on faith, but more than 2,000 verses on money and possessions.* 

Please let me know if you have any additional questions. Appreciate you working ahead on behalf of your guys and all you’re doing!
