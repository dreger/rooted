Please take a few short minutes to watch the Week 9 Training Video and be sure to review pages 89-92 in your Facilitator Guide for tips on how to lead a Serve Experience. 

## Sharing YOUR Story

We tell everyone about all the mundane, insignificant great things in our lives already: that old show where you laugh so hard you cry, the new show that you cry so hard you laugh, that incredible brand that’s disrupting the paperclip industry, and the restaurant where they put Korean food into a taco form.
 
In this last week of Rooted together, it seeks to help everyone distill their stories into concise explanations of God’s goodness in our lives. We want to develop an understanding of God’s involvement in our lives so we can tell others. Being a storyteller is all about advocating for something by explaining our experience with it and how it’s changed our lives. It’s about simply wanting others to taste and see for themselves what God has done for us. It’s an invitation with an explanation. It’s not about being abrasive, having all the right answers, or feeling finished with what we’ve experienced or may still be learning.

**When we tell our story, we’re partnering with what God is already doing in someone’s life to pull them closer to God.**

We can argue against straw-men, philosophical ideals, and historical questions surrounding the nature of God and reality all we want. However, none of that matters if our abstract ideas don’t impact our concrete reality. We need to not just believe in God, but also experience him. That’s what this Rooted journey is all about—balancing knowledge with practice.

Make sure to challenge your group to be praying about an opportunity to share their story with someone, if they haven’t already. This is part of the Rooted Experience.

## Cards & Rooted Stories

In this final week together, take some time to let everyone share their experiences with Rooted. What pieces were most meaningful to them? Has something changed in their lives? It doesn’t have to be some big revelation, but something most likely has happened that’s moved them a little closer to Jesus.

We believe that “the story you live in is the story you live out.” That’s what Rooted is all about—understanding the story of God and our place inside of it. So, in your group, we are asking you to make a card that flips from “I WAS _______ “ to “JESUS IS _______.” It could be a single word or it could be a phrase. Feel free to break the mold and think outside the box. These cards could help them both with their bigger story, but specifically for Week 10 help them tell their story when it comes their Rooted experience as well.

### RESPONSE Cards

Separate from the cards above, these cards are for each person in your group. These are to help facilitate telling their story after week 9, they will talk about what Jesus has done for them in this Rooted season for Week 10 before you speak truth into their lives. It doesn’t have to be confined to their story from this specific season, but it is helpful to reflect on the positive things that have happened.

These cards are slightly different than the “Cardboard Testimonies” mentioned in Facilitator Guide, but will allow everyone to participate. On one side they say “10 Weeks Ago, I _______” and the other says “Today, I _______.” Feel free to let them explain beyond those constraints. We have also included checkboxes for Group members to indicate if they’re ready to share their ROOTED Story or Lead a ROOTED Group. 

You can simply download/print the ROOTED Response Card [HERE](https://firstchristian.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ROOTED-Response-Card.pdf) (click to print attached PDF) or pickup the pre-printed cards at the Welcome Center this weekend.

### Stories

Be SURE to relay one or two stories we could tell at the Celebration. We want to put a few stories on display for everyone to celebrate what Jesus has been doing this season. 

Email nextsteps@firstchristian.com to nominate anyone that comes to mind or submit a story by clicking the button below.

## LOOK AHEAD | Important Decisions & Dates

**Preparing for Week 10.** Prep your group to think through one or two encouraging truths they want to share with each person in their group. Maybe encourage them to think of a word, a phrase, quality, or a passion that comes to mind when they think about each individual in their group.

The point of the ROOTED experience is to help establish 7 Rhythms that foster a transformational lifestyle. We want to provide a few opportunities to help everyone continue:

### 1) ROOTED Group Decision

Over the next few weeks, see if your group wants to commit to continuing basically as they are or plan to transition at the end of the ROOTED Experience. 

We will follow up with individuals privately if this decision works for them.

### 2) Facilitator Nominations

We want to hear from you about three different people. 

- One or two people who might want to share their story at the Celebration. 
- Someone to lead this group if it continues (it could be you).
- Someone in your group that might be especially interested or gifted at leading a Rooted group. Talk to them privately about why you chose them too.  

We don’t need an answer to any of these too soon, *EXCEPT for the story nominations*.

### 3) Baptisms

Lastly, make sure your group knows we will be doing Baptisms at the Celebration.

If anyone in your group is interested in truly going all-in with Jesus, point them to that date and have them go to [FirstChristian.com/baptism](http://www.firstchristian.com/baptism) to sign-up. We’d love for you to be a part of that day too!

Please let me know if you have any additional questions. Appreciate you working on behalf of your groups and all that you’re doing!
