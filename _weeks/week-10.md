Please take a few short minutes to watch the Week 10 Training Video and  [Prophetic Prayer – Facilitator Training](https://vimeo.com/170240318) and review pages 95-100 in your Facilitator Guide for tips on how to lead your Group Discussion during the Celebration Experience.

## Speaking Truth into Each Other

As we approach the final Celebration on week 10, remember this is an opportunity to point out all that you’ve seen God doing in the life of each person in your group. Do that through a personal card and/or verbally in your group time. Encourage your group to point out the individual giftings, character strengths, and passions worth pursuing in their lives.

- “I’ve noticed you’re super compassionate, especially when it comes to the racial tension in our city. You should get involved serving at with our Impact team.”
- “You have no idea how much people look up to you. Embrace the leadership opportunities God is calling you to right now.”
- “I know it’s been tough to forgive yourself, but know that God sees beyond those decisions. He loves you unconditionally and is building something beautiful in you. I’d encourage you to continue to let him replace those ideas you have about yourself with the ones God is says about who you are now. Let Him break down those strongholds.” 

Allow each person time and space to talk about what the ROOTED Experience has meant to them and then have your group speak these kinds of truths and encouragement into each other’s lives. Then, have someone (or yourself) pray over that person. Use your discretion and your Facilitators Guide to think through what this looks like.

## What’s Next?

Finish the conversation surrounding what’s next with your group. Let me know what you all decide, but make sure it’s essentially unanimous. Don’t keep going for another month or season begrudgingly. 

Please let us know what you decide to do via email:

```
	After this Rooted Season ends, our group intends to…(check all that apply)
	[  ] Stay Together for the Next Church Study/Series Materials
	[  ] Stay Together using another study or resource 
	[  ] Find Another Group/Situation (We can help them find another group)
```

We will be in touch with everyone to make a decision about that season individually.

## Preparing for the Celebration

Send a text or email to your group beforehand and prepare your group to think through one or two encouraging truths they want to share with each person in their group. 

Maybe encourage them to think of a word, a phrase, quality, or a passion that comes to mind when they think about each individual in their group.

## Cardboard Testimonies

At the Celebration, we will be highlighting some stories from this season of Rooted. 

We’re asking every group to submit 1-2 group members that might be willing to share their story. Email nextsteps@firstchristian.com with their name or submit a story by clicking the button below. We will contact and coordinate with them about what this will look like.
